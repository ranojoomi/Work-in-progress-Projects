Here is some of the recent projects I am currently working on.

Beta&HistoricalReturns.py takes a stock inputted by the user and can calculate the beta or show the value of 
$10,000 invested in this stock based on the period inputted.

ReturnsvsRisksRegression.py takes data from the stocks of the S&P 100 and runs a regression based on the expected return of each stock
and the standard deviation

S&p500Sim.py calculates the historic returns and standard deviation of the weekly changes in the S&P 500 and then runs many simulations
so show some possible directions the S&P 500 can go to. This assumes the returns are normally distributed.
